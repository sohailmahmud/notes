Create an app’s landing page on a free hosting (Git Pages for instance) like I’ve done for UVIMate - Sun Safety Coach app. 1 day, free template.
Put a couple of slick apps screenshoots and try to “fund-rise” the money from your potential users using “Donate/PayPal” button. 3 hours to set all the Java Script widgets.
Go to Reddit and Hacker News and sumbit the link on your page. 1 hour.
Collect fundraisers emails to send them promo-codes after developing. 4 hours.
Create app page on Facebook and Twitter. Use social media for free marketing. 30 min.
Start blogging in your app’s niche. 30 mins/per day.
Don’t start any development until you get your first donation!
All the steps will take just 16 hours and help you to validate your idea before the market launch.
