## Brainstorming Technique

1. Identify a user and a set of use cases.
2. Brainstorm with the user to identify things involved when carrying out the use case—that is, things about which information should be captured by the system.
3. Use the types of things (categories) to systematically ask questions about potential things, such as the following: Are there any tangible things you store information about? Are there any locations involved? Are there roles played by people that you need to remember?
4. Continue to work with all types of users and stakeholders to expand the brainstorming list.
5. Merge the results, eliminate any duplicates, and compile an initial list.

## Noun Technique

1. Using the use cases, actors, and other information about the system—including inputs and outputs—identify all nouns.
2. Using other information from existing systems, current procedures, and current reports or forms, add items or categories of information needed.
3. As this list of nouns builds, you will need to refine it. Ask these questions about each noun to help you decide whether you should include it:
   - Ask questions, such as is it important and inside the scope, to see if it should be included.
   - Ask questions to see if it really should be excluded, such as is it only a report or an input or is it an attribute.
   - Ask questions to see if it needs further research. In other words that you cannot answer whether it needs to be included or excluded.
4. Create a master list of all nouns identified and then note whether each one should be included, excluded, or researched further.
5. Review the list with users, stakeholders, and team members and then refine the list of things in the problem domain.
