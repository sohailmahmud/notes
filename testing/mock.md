# Mock Notes

## Michael Foord (creator of mock library)

### [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3_LdLzWSXQ)

- Mock is a library to create mock (fake) objects that can be used to replace parts of your system under test.
- Mock is a spy, fake, double object
- Mock follows Arrange, Act, Assert pattern of testing

  - Arrange - set up system under test
  - Act - call the system under test
  - Assert - make sure the right things have happened

- `from unittest.mock import:`

  - MagicMock (like Mock, but supports `__magic__` methods)
  - patch
  - call
  - ANY

- Mock object are mocks all the way down

  - access attribute, returns mock object
  - call a function, returns a mock object

- Mock objects track their usage (`.called`, `.call_count`, `.mock_calls`)

  - pass a mock object into our system under test
  - system uses it in a certain way
  - we make assertions about how it was used

- PyCon 2016 mock talk by ana something
  - cause of truthy value, make sure your asserts are right
  - but we can use spec=True, to make sure we aren't magically passing tests

### [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADIcwu2GeEU)

- Why use mock?

  - Isolation
  - Determinism (deterministic models produce the same output from a given startinc condition or initial state)
  - make test rliable, producing the same answer every time
  - Speed / Performance
  - Avoiding dependencies on external systems

- Unit tests are isolated, need to be fast, and need useful tracebacks

- Use mocks objects to fake out parts of an external API to make tests deterministic and compare to known preprocessed results

### [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFA-FFaEZPo)

- Django test runner starts up a test database. All this time adds up
- Use mocks to mock out things like the database
- patch lets you replace objects in your system with mock objects
  - monkeypatching
    - easy to do, don't forget to replace
    - context manager is a good way because it has a closing step
      - and you control scope of patch
    - function decorator
    - class decorator, applies same patch to every single method in the class
      - but does it at creation time, decorator is not reapplied
- Step to do mock

  - figure out how the object will be use
  - mock that behavior
  - use the mock object as it should be
  - assert it was used the way you intended

- What to assert

  - response.status_code
  - assertIn('text', response.content)
  - use [pyquery](https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/), jquery-esque lib from python, to test against actual stuff

- patch is interesting
  - do the patch where the name is looked up

#### Question

- Should we test render? It's a django function after all
  - BUT YES we should because templates have logic
  - If you have branches for different templates, make sure you test those too

- dependency injection does not mean this

```python
def my_func(database=None):
  if database is None:
    # construction
```

## [The Tao of Testing](http://jasonpolites.github.io/tao-of-testing/index-1.1.html)

- unit test - Test a single public method or function
- black box test - test provides data and expects certain results without knowing how those results are derived
- integration test - many parts of the system are tested at once, tests a complete end-to-end lifecycle of an application or a portion versus testing selected components independently
- manual test - test completed by human
- load/scale test - impose stress on application by simulating heavy load conditions / highly concurrent load conditions
- infrastructure test - testing infrastructure underlying software
- QA test - like manual tests
- UAT (user acceptance testing) - human test assess implementation of software to see if it meets specifications

### [A Case for Testing](http://jasonpolites.github.io/tao-of-testing/ch1-1.1.html)

- Bugs will happen, you can bank on it, only the severity of their impact will vary.
- Bug incidents can increase dramatically as new features are added
- Bug fix times can increase dramatically as new features are added
- Software testing is NOT designed to make sure code works when it’s written but rather to ensure future changes do not break existing code.
- A well run, tightly managed testing regime leads to more stable, reusable code.

### [Chapter 4 - How to Write Tests](http://jasonpolites.github.io/tao-of-testing/ch4-1.1.html#guidebook-for-writing-tests)

#### Mocking dependencies to create isolated tests

> A mock object is an object that implements the same signature as the object it is mocking, but does not possess any of the actual implementation. That is, as far as the application is concerned it “looks” like the real thing, but it’s actually a fake.
>
> The behavior of the mock object is orchestrated as part of the test so that it produces predictable outputs.

1. Mocks of real objects are easily created without needing to implement all required methods
1. Test conditions are easily orchestrated by setting expectations on mocks
1. Mocks allow assertions of methods called and method parameters as well as methods NOT called.
