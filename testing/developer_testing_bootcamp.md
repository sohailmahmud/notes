# Developer Testing Bootcamp

- We test to reduce the gap between the time when defects are intorduced into the code and the time when those defects are detected

## Adopt a Tester's Mindset

- We need a good definition of testing
- BDD - behavior driven development. Gerkin: [Given When Then](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html)

## Test Early; Test Often

## Automate your Tests

- use a framework
- don't build tests that test your business logic via the UI
- UI is always changing so we should have less of these tests

## Grow Code with Tests

- TDD

## Integrate Often

- CI

## Ensure Functional Coverage

- Design-by-Contract
- Decision Tables

## Ensure Domain Coverage

- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary-Value Analysis
- Pairwise Testing

## Ensure Code Coverage

- Statement Coverage
- Branch Coverage
- Basis Path Coverage
- Multiple Condition Coverage
- MCDC Coverage

## Design for Testability

- Simplify
- Make Dependencies Replaceable
- Test with Doubles

- dependency lookup for higher level tests (integration tests)
  - check a config file

## Write Test Code with Care

- Keep your Test Code Clean
- Test your tests
