## Preface

> When complexity gets out of hand, developers can no longer understand the software well enough to change or extend it easily and safely. On the other hand, a good design can create opportunities to exploit those complex features.

Book's main themes:

1. For most software projects, the primary focus should be on the domain and domain logic.
2. Complex domain designs should be based on a model.
