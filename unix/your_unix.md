# Your Unix

By Sumitabha Das

## Chapter 6: The File System

- Everything in UNIX is a file

Types of files:

- ordinary file - contains data as a stream of characters
- directory file - folder that contains the names of other files and directories
- device file - represents a hardware device

### Directories

- `/bin` and `/usr/bin` are where we keep commonly used user binaries
- `/sbin` and `/usr/sbin` are for system admins
- `/etc` holds system config files
- `/dev` contains device files
- `/home` is where all user files are
- `/tmp` is best place to store temporary files
- `/var` variable part of the files system
- `/lib` is for library files

- `$HOME` ENV VAR holds home directory

`.` - current directory
`..` - parent directory
`./cmd` - Runs cmd in current directory (places it higher up in $PATH that if we just ran it without)
