# The Passionate Programmer

By Chad Fowler

## Choosing Your Market

### Tip 1: Lead or Bleed

> Both ends of the technology adoption curve might prove to be lucrative

_Thoughts_

Figuring out which technologies to invest time in learning is something we should be extremely deliberate about.

- Do you want to jump on something new only to have it fade into obscurity? Learn how to read trends. Always stay on top of the latest happenings. Need to make this easier somehow.
- Learning something entrenched means safety, but you are a dime a dozen coder. How to differentiate? Add a twist to the entrenched technology.
- Learing something that is close to dying out means you can be an expert in a niche field. But always have to be on the lookout for signs where we need to move on to something else

### Tip 2: Supply and Demand

> You cannot compete against offshore programmers on price, but you can compete on ability

- Following the jobs will put you in price competition with offshore developers.
- To compete in mainstream technology, we have to compete at a higher skill level
- Or learn technologies that offshore companies will not learn

_Thoughts_

Again, it all comes down to finding your niche. What is your value add? How is your skillset unique? What do you bring to the table?

### Tip 3: Coding Doesn't Cut it Anymore

> If you want to stay relevant, you're going to have to dive into the domain of the business you're in

- Don't be "just a programmer", but be able to speak to your clients in their language
- Put the same level of care into selecting which industry to serve as you put into selecting which technologies to master

_Thoughts_

Specialization does limit your options, but it also makes your more in demand for the specific niche you occupy. I didn't get my first fulltime developer job because I can code, I got it because I have domain expertise (in healthcare and clinical decision support) to compliment my programming skills.

### Tip 4: Be the Worst

> Being the worst guy in the band means always playing iwth people who are better than you

_Thoughts_

- Challenge yourself and work with people better than you. Soon you will start emulating their good habits

### Tip 5: Invest in Your Intelligence

> More technically competant people seek diverse experience because they learn to love new things or being forced into alien experiences and environments makes them more mature, well-rounded software developers

- Stepping out of your comfort zone shows that you are motivated and engaged, but it also makes you deeper, better, smarter, and more creative

_Thoughts_

Invest in learning subjects that force you to think outside of the box. If you know OOP, learn functional programming!

Being able to think in different ways will make us better problem solvers. We can never have enough tools in our repetoire. I learned Angular 1 a few years back in order to build a decision support tool. Even though the technology is obsolete, learning Angular taught me the principles of MVC which made me into a better programmer.

Being interested in what you do also shows your passion. So start a blog, give talks, become a mentor.

### Tip 6: Don't Listen to Your Parents

> Don't be fear-driven, take calculated risks with your career. Don't let fear consume you. And if you're not having fun, you're not going to be excellent

_Thoughts_

Programming for a living is a difficult job so you'll need to love what you do in order to be successful. Don't be content with mediocrity.

### Tip 7: Be a Generalist

> Be the person everybody turns to when problems arise. Be useful. Your skills should transcend technology platforms

_Thoughts_

There is a lot of stuff to learn, but you don't need to master everything. As long as you can connect the dots fairl well, you'll have a leg up on everybody else.

How many data scientists can actually code and fix their own problems without StackOverflow? Wouldn't they be more effective at their jobs if the actually learned the language they are using in a deeper way?

### Tip 8: Be a Specialist

> Too many of us seem to believe that specializing in something simply means you don't know about other things

_Thoughts_

Make sure you understand the things you do. Don't just blindly code without thinking about what is going on behind the scenes. Abstraction is good, but you should be able to go one or two layers deep.

### Tip 9: Don't Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket

> Vendor-centric views are typically myopic
>
> If you do have to invest in a technology, make sure it's an open source project

_Thoughts_

Be framework agnostic. Know how to solve problems. Know design patterns. Know algorithms. Concepts are universal. Frameworks are not, they are opinionated and you need to understand limitations and how to bypass.

### Tip 10: Love It or Leave It

> You have to be passionate about your work if you want to be great at your work. If you don't care, it will show

_Thoughts_

Programming is hard. It will be you down. It will make you feel stupid. If you don't enjoy every single moment of the experience, you won't be remarkable.

## Investing in Your Product

### Tip 11: Learn to Fish

> Who wants to be at the mercy of someone else? Don't let important things be voodoo to you.
>
> Don't let important things be like voodoo to you.
>
> The best software people become experts in their domains. They build better products and work faster than a develoepr who does not understand the business.

_Thoughts_

- In order to get projects off the ground, it helps to be able to do things across the entire stack. This is more true for solo projects, but having a deeper knowledgebase makes it so you don't need to wait or somebody to help you. You can solve your own problem.

- If you don't understand the business problem you are trying to solve, you won't make a very valuable contributor to your team.

### Tip 12: Learn How Businesses Really Work

> Figure out the business domain that best fits your skillset and current/future state of the market
>
> You can't creatively help a business be profitable if you don't understand how the business works

_Thoughts_

- Every single programmer has technical knowledge, but do they have domain knowledge?

### Tip 13: Find a Mentor

> Mentor helps set the standard for what "good" means. A mentor can add structure to your learning process. Mentor is invested in your success.

_Thoughts_

- Having a mentor to bounce ideas off of made me better. I was putting together a very high level (read: meh) blog post / presentation on Python Context Managers. My mentor told me that it was a subject that a lot of people already knew about. Even though the material I was covering would be useful to newbie coders, I should go deeper and dig into the topic. Doing the research for my post (and then presentation) on Context Managers made me a better developer. It got me to think about Python language features, and language features in general, in a lot more depth. Without a guide, I would be lost.

### Tip 14: Be a Mentor

> If you want to really learn something, try teaching it to someone else

_Thoughts_

- Giving talks, writing blog posts, pointing friends in the right direction. These are all the ways that I've been a mentor. Rewarding experience because you help somebody understand something, but also selfish because you take something away as well.

### Tip 15: Practice, Practice, Practice

> Athletes push themselves to the limit during workouts so they can expand those limits for the real performances. Our industry tends to practice on the job.

_Thoughts_

- Figure out your weaknesses. Make them strengths by learning and practicing. Force yourself to learn something by throwing yourself into the deep end and forcing yourself to swim.

### Tip 16: The Way That You Do It

> It's as important to focus on the process we're using as it is to focus on the product being developed. Much of this prior art has been codified into a group of methodologies.

_Thoughts_

- Don't really have a lot of experience with project methodologies, but reading Code Complete made me realize that structure is good. This is a topic I'm interested in learning more about.

### Tip 17: On the Shoulders of Giants

> We can mine a huge body of existing code for patterns and tricks

_Thoughts_

- We learn how to get better by looking at how those better developers solve problems

### Tip 18: Automate Yourself into a Job

> High skilled coders are worth more than an army of low paid / low skill workers

_Thoughts_

Be good at what you do. Understand the ins and outs of your profession. This is your career. Treat it like one

## Execution

### Tip 19: Right Now

> Parkinson's Law: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"
>
> A sense of urgency, even if manufactured, will double or triple your productivity. You'll get it done, instead of talking about getting it done.

_Thoughts_

- Lots of mini-deadlines help you get a sense of accomplishment as you are working through a task list.

### Tip 20: Mind Reader

> Listen to what people are saying and learn to anticipate what they want before they even know they want them

_Thoughts_

- Listen to what people want. Make it in the corner and then be the wizard who knows how to do everything. Don't unveil half complete projects, always make sure it is some sort of MVP.

### Tip 21: Daily Hit

> Simply setting a goal and tracking your accomplishments can radically change your behavior

_Thoughts_

### Tip 22: Remember Who You Work For

> Align yourself with the needs of your business by solving your manager's problems

_Thoughts_

This is a lot more difficult to do in a larger organization where there are many layers between you and the organizational goal. Be useful to your manager and solve his / her problem and you'll be golden.

### Tip 23: Be Where You're At

> Focusing on the present will get you further towards your goal than focusing on the goal itself

_Thoughts_

Take pride in what you do. If you phone it in, you'll never get ahead.

### Tip 24: How Good a Job Can I Do Today?

> When we have more fun, we do better work

_Thoughts_

- Make your job into a game. Try to beat your time for a boring repetitive task.

### Tip 25: How Much Are You Worth?

> How much value do I add to the bottom line?

_Thoughts_

- Always look for ways to improve things in order to save the company money, improve a process for a client, etc

### Tip 26: A Pebble in a Bucket of Water

> Beware of being blinded by your own success

_Thoughts_

- As great as we think we are, nobody is irreplaceable. We are all just cogs in a wheel. Never get complacent.

### Tip 27: Learn to Love Maintenance

> Embrace Maintencance programming and make it a mission to learn how to do stuff well

_Thoughts_

- Maintenance work isn't sexy, but it needs to be done. Take pride in what you do. Use the maintenance phase to learn the business inside and out.

### Tip 28: Eight-Hour Burn

> Eight-Hour Burn is when you work so relentlessly that there is no way you could continue longer than eight hours.

- Budget your work hours carefully. Work less, and you'll accomplish more. Work is always more wlecome when you've gven yourself time away from it

_Thoughts_

- Go in. Work hard for 4 hours. Take a break. Work hard for another 4 hours.
- You have a live outside of work to waste time and surf the internet

### Tip 29: Learn How to Fail

> Even masters play wrong notes, but they recover in such a way that the listener can't tell if the whole thing wasn't intentional

How to deal with a technical, communication, or project management mistake:

- Raise the issue as early as you know about it
- Take the blame
- Offer a solution
- Ask for help

_Thoughts_

- It's not about messing, it's about learning from the screwup and figuring out a way to never let it happen again. We are judged by how we come back from setbacks, not the setback itself.

### Tip 30: Say No

> The quickest path to missing your commitments is to make commitments that you know you can't meet. Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know"

_Thoughts_

- Don't act like you know everything or can do everything just to answer a question or make somebody happy. Be honest about your limits that way you will build trust with those who work around you. You are a person of your word

### Tip 31: Don't Panic

> Heroes never panic.

_Thoughts_

- Panic leads to subpark performance. Stop, take a moment to access, continue after taking a deep breath.

### Tip 32: Say It, Do It, Show It

> If you say what you're going to do and then you do it and show that it's done, you develop a reputation for being a doer

- Planning can be liberating. Make a list of items to get done next. Keep going with the Pomodoro technique until you get your todo list done

_Thoughts_

- If you plan out your work, you are more likely to accomplish it. Use task management systems like Getting Things Done to stay on top of the workload.

## Marketing... Not Just for Suits

### Tip 33: Perceptions, Perschmeptions

> There is no way to objectively measure the quality of a knowledge worker or their work, so you are measured on someone else's perception of you

- Understanding what's important in each of your relationships is an important part of building credible perceptions with those you interact with

_Thoughts_

- As much as you shouldn't care what people think of you, you need to put in effort into every single relationship you ahve

### Tip 34: Adventure Tour Guide

> Customers and managers are looking for someone who can make them comfortable about the project they are working on. Be cognizant that your customers may need topics toned down a bit when you've discussed software related matters

_Thoughts_

- Being able to talk about something intelligently means you are able to communicate concepts to an audience of varied skill levels

### Tip 35: Me Rite Reel Nice

> Much of your job involves writing and people base their perceptions of you based on your writing ability so you need to get good at it

_Thoughts_

- Take some time to organize your thoughts before you respond, make sure you don't sound scatterbrained

### Tip 36: Being Present

> Learn about your colleagues

_Thoughts_

Yes we are here to work, but make work enjoyable and get to know your coworkers. What do they like. It's not bad to start taking notes.

### Tip 37: Suit Speak

> People that run businesses are interested in results so market your accomplishments in the language of your business

_Thoughts_

- How are you adding to the bottom line? You're not a cog in the wheel, you need to have a full scale understanding of everything that needs to be done

### Tip 38: Change the World

> You need to come into work on a mission to effect change through your team, organization or company

_Thoughts_

- Have a purpose. You can't just go to work and only do what is expected of you. Look for ways to improve current processes. Take initiative

### Tip 39: Let Your Voice Be Heard

> Think beyond your next promotion or the company you work for. You are a craftsperson and an artist within a large industry.

_Thoughts_

- Everybody had something to share. Become an expert by writing and giving talks. Fake it until you make it.

### Tip 40: Build Your Brand

> Your name is your brand. Make your mark so that people recognize it and make sure that your mark is associated with positive traits. The most potentially destructive force for Brand You is yourself.

_Thoughts_

- You need to put yourself out there in a way that people will look at you as an expert. Don't fuck up and be a dick. Don't do lousy work. This is your life, get your shit together.

### Tip 41: Release Your Code

> Contributing to open source is another way to makert yourself and it also shows you are passionate about your field

- Refactorum - take a piece of open source code with unit tests, run tests thru test coverage analyzer, find least tested part of the system and write test to improve coverage of that code. Untested code is often untestable. Refactor to make code more testable. Submit changes as a patch.

_Thoughts_

- Public contributions to big projects raise your profile.

### Tip 42: Remarkability

> To be remakrable, you ahve to be significantly different from those around you. You also need to be doing. It's not enough to be the best, you need to show you are the best

_Thoughts_

_Thoughts_

- Putting yourself out there and connecting with people also increases your profile and your social connectiveness

## Maintaining Your Edge

### Tip 44: Already Obsolete

> Success breeds hubris, which breeds complacency

_Thoughts_

- Our industry is always evolving and we have to be continuously learning. Yes it sucks to have to study all the time, but it will ensure that we don't go obsolete. Also, doesn't it sound kind of boring to do the same thing over and over again

### Tip 45: You've Already Lost Your Job

> Don't buy too heavily into a long, imagined future. Can't afford to have tunnel vision with something too far off in the future. To hit a moving target, you have to aim to where the target is going to be

_Thoughts_

- Figure out where you want to go and take a little bit of a windy road to get where you want to be. By taking the scenic route, we have flexbility to change the set path we are on

### Tip 46: Path with No Destination

> The real meat of your career is the time you spend working on yourself and your skills not on the advacements you make

_Thoughts_

- It's the journey, not the destination. If we aim for the moon and miss, we've still gone pretty far!

### Tip 47: Make Yourself a Map

> It's a good idea to think about the story your skillset tells

_Thoughts_

- Are you just wandering around or are you structured about how you learn the things you want to learn. Are you working towards a goal? Track and find out.

### Tip 48: Watch the Market

> Watch the alpha geeks

_Thoughts_

- Where is the technology going? Are you learning the right thing? Keep abreast of industry developments

### Tip 49: That Fat Man in the Mirror

> If you're constantly exposed to something, it's hard to see it change unless the change happens rapidly

_Thoughts_

- Monitor your progress, but also ask for honest feedback about how you are doing

### Tip 50: The South Indian Monkey Trap

> If you believe something so strongly that you no longer objectively question it, you have blind spots.

_Thoughts_

- If you only know how to hammer, everything looks like a nail. What do you believe strongly? What do you need to work on to think differently?

### Tip 51: Avoid Waterfall Career Planning

> Iterating to a solution is always less stressful and more effective

_Thoughts_

- You need to be adaptable to change. Change isn't just possible, it's inevitable.

_Thoughts_

- Life is reps. Put in the time and you will see results

### Tip 53: Go Independent
